    Investigation of optical properties of top-down fabricated InGaN nanowires (NW) from layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), using Spectroscopic ellipsometry, micro photoluminescence (µ-PL), reflectance-transmittance measurements. Numerical simulations using Lumerical FDTD & FDE to predict the absorptance and supported guided and resonant leaky modes in the GaAs NWs and InGaN NWs.
